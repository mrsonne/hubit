# Calculations for a wall

Both engineering and management. Same model results provided controlled by query.

Using different queries it is therefore straight forward to set up different reports 
for management, for clients, for independant verification agencies, and 
for internal design engineers.

## Engineering models

* Segment thermal conductivities
* Segment thermal profile
* Segment volume
* Segment weight
* Maximum heat flow

## Cost models

* Segment cost
* Total cost
